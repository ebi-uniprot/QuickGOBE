/**
 * Stores the result of the aggregation section found within the response of the underlying data source.
 * <p/>
 * An instance of an aggregation could have one or several of the following:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The name of the aggregation. If the aggregation is based on a field, then the name is name of the field,
 *     however if the aggregation is based on a query result then the name could be anything.</li>
 *     <li>A set of {@link AggregationResult}s: An aggregation result is a value that reflects the application of
 *     an {@link AggregateFunction} on a particular field. This field could be the aggregate field, or any other
 *     field that can be calculated within the response's ability, example: sum(field1) or unique(field2)</li>
 *     <li>A set of {@link AggregationBucket}: Each bucket represents a distinct value of the field being
 *     aggregated upon, as well as any {@link AggregationResult} applied to the bucket value</li>
 *     <li>A set of {@link AggregateResponse#nestedAggregations}: A nested aggregation is a drilled down view of the main
 *     aggregation. This means that it tries to retrieve metrics on a different aggregate field, but always based on
 *     the result of the current aggregation</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * As an example, assume that the data source has a table/collection of orders, with the following fields:
 * order_item_id, quantity, cost.
 * Sending an {@link AggregateRequest} object, to the data store, with the following requests:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>provide the total cost of all orders</li>
 *     <li>aggregate on order_item_id</li>
 *        <ul>
 *            <li>sum the quantity of all items with the same order_item_id</li>
 *        </ul>
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * Aggregating on the field would turn up an the following aggregation:
 * <pre>
 * aggregation:
 *    - name: query_result
 *    - aggregationResults: [5] - where 5 represents the total cost of all orders
 *    - nestedAggregations: [
 *        - name: order_item_id
 *        - aggregationBuckets: [
 *            - value: order_item_1
 *                - aggregationResults: [10] - where 10 represents the sum of the quantities for order_item_1
 *            - value: order_item_2
 *                - aggregationResults: [5] - where 5 represents the sum of the quantities for order_item_2
 *            ...
 *        ]
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * If {@link AggregateRequest} instances are attached to the
 * {@link uk.ac.ebi.quickgo.rest.search.query.QueryRequest}, then the underlying data source will always return
 * aggregate specific data.
